## Brightness Controller

Brightness Controller is a Java application in charge of controlling your screen brightness based on the brightness of the colors of your screen, for example:

 * Imagine you are programming in some IDE with a dark theme with a certain bright level on your screen, then, you switch to Chrome to use Facebook with a lot of white on your screen, your eyes burn! Too much bright! So you reduce your screen brightness you don't need lot of brightness to read.

Brightness Controller do this for automatically! Is very simple to use just open the app, click on the start button and the program will automatically adjust the brightness for you!

## Current state

* Brightness Controller is in Beta so there are only a few features.
* Currently Brightness Controller is only available on Spanish, I will translate to English as soon as I can.
* There is no way to modify the brightness algorithm, I will be adding more options to configure brightness adjustment so you can configure it according to your screen or likes.
* Brightness Controller currently only works on Windows but I am working on a Linux version (having performance issues).
* I will be creating an installer so you can download it without compiling the code.
